# Carbon Forum Modernized
**A modern, secure, and scalable forum software, originally Carbon-Forum, now updated with the latest technologies.**

## üìå Overview
This repository provides a modernized version of the Carbon-Forum software. The original project was a high-performance, open-source forum. This version aims to update its underlying technologies for better security, performance, and maintainability, making it suitable for contemporary web environments.
It is designed to be easy to deploy, mobile-first (retaining original responsive features), and secure against common vulnerabilities with updated practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Target)
- **Backend:** PHP 8.2+ (PDO, Composer)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, ES6+ JavaScript
- **Libraries (Planned/In-Progress):** Alpine.js (for jQuery replacement), potentially Tailwind CSS (or updated Bootstrap), Guzzle HTTP (if external calls are needed beyond basic cURL).
- **Database:** MySQL (via PDO)

## üß∞ Prerequisites
- PHP 8.2+
- MySQL 8.0+ (or compatible MariaDB)
- Composer (for PHP dependencies)
- Web Server (Apache with mod_rewrite, Nginx)

## üöÄ Installation
*(Instructions will be updated once modernization is stable)*

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git # Replace with actual repo URL
    cd your-repo
    ```
2.  **Install PHP dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3.  **Set up the database:**
    *   Create a MySQL database and user.
    *   Import the schema from `database/schema.sql` (this path will be created).
    ```bash
    mysql -u youruser -p yourdatabase < database/schema.sql
    ```
4.  **Configure `config.php`:**
    *   Copy `config.php.template` (if one is created) or manually create `config.php` based on the installer's original requirements or a new template.
    *   Update database credentials, site URL, and other necessary settings.
    *(The original installer at `/install/` might be adapted or replaced with manual config + a setup script).*
5.  **Web Server Configuration:**
    *   Ensure your web server's document root points to the project's public directory (e.g., `public/` - this will be created).
    *   Enable URL rewriting (`.htaccess` for Apache, or Nginx config).
6.  **Start the server (for local development with PHP built-in server):**
    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000 -t public/ # Assuming index.php will be in public/
    ```

## üìÅ Project Structure (Target)
```
src/                # PHP backend logic (Controllers, Models, Services, Core)
views/              # HTML templates (Default, Mobile, API)
public/             # Static assets (CSS, JS, images), index.php (entry point)
database/           # Database schema and migrations
  schema.sql
config/             # Configuration files (e.g., for routes, services if extracted)
library/            # Original library folder, may contain vendor or be phased out for src/
  vendor/           # Composer dependencies
composer.json       # PHP dependencies
README.md           # This file
LICENSE             # License file
.gitignore          # Git ignore rules
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features (Planned/In-Progress)
- SQL injection protection via prepared statements (inherent with PDO usage).
- CSRF tokens for form submissions.
- Input validation and output sanitization (e.g., `filter_var()`, `htmlspecialchars()`).
- Updated security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, CSP).
- HTTPS enforcement (via web server configuration).

## üß™ Testing
*(Testing strategy to be defined)*
- Run unit tests (planned):
  ```bash
  vendor/bin/phpunit
  ```
- Lint PHP:
  ```bash
  php -l path/to/file.php
  # Or a script to lint all PHP files
  ```

## üì¶ Missing Packages?
- **If missing:** Check `composer.json` for required packages.
- **To add:** Run `composer require vendor/package-name`.

## üß© Known Issues & Improvements
- **Issue:** Original project is archived and uses outdated PHP versions and practices.
- **Issue:** jQuery needs to be replaced with vanilla JS or Alpine.js.
- **Issue:** CSS needs updating to modern standards (Flexbox/Grid).
- **Planned Improvements:**
  - Full PHP 8.2+ compatibility.
  - Modernized HTML5/CSS3/ES6+ frontend.
  - Improved code structure (PSR-4 autoloading, clear MVC separation).
  - Enhanced security features.
  - Update/replace outdated libraries.
  - Comprehensive `README.md` and potentially `CHANGELOG.md`.
